# ZombieSurvival
Originally developed by Bjornke in 2014 for Minecraft 1.7.2, this project has been reprogrammed and improved for newer versions of Minecraft

NOTE THAT THIS PROJECT WAS ONLY DESIGNED FOR MINECRAFT 1.18.1.

The last time I worked on this was in 2021. I haven't touched this project since. Not even sure which version of the project this is since I never used version tracking but I believe this is a stable version. It may need to be tweaked as I noticed Spigot's API has been a little funky these past few years.

From what I remember, this project had very few bugs, and I was working on a simple way of improving Minecraft's pathfinding with the Navigation Nodes and the room generator. That is most likely the only part of the project that has bugs.

This site will be updated soon to show how to use the plugin in-game: <a href="https://micro230.com/zombiesurvival">https://micro230.com/zombiesurvival</a>
